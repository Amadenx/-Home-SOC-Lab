Home SOC Lab  
Objective

[Brief Objective]

As my journey to Cyber Security field continues, I have decided to choose my path to become Security Operations Center Analyst. I am very interested in analyzing and detecting threats on networks and systems.

I have been setting up Virtual Machines to create a SOC lab in a comfort of my own home.

I have used VirtualBox to deploy VM and insert pfSense software on it. I have created a network and set up IP addresses for my own LAN.

 

My next step was creating a second Virtual Machine with Windows Server 2022 so I could setup domain in Active Directory.

2)Active Directory/Windows Server 2022

Finally, I am deploying a workstation in my third VM with Windows 10 system installed on there, which I managed to join to my existing domain and internal network on pfSense.

3)Workstation Windows 11/Finalization of SOC Lab
